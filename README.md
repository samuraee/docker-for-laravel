# Basic assumptions
1. The entrypoint of all containers are supervisord process and the rest processes will be handle using **supervisord** facilities.
2. Everything should be customizable such as non-root username, PHP version, nodejs version, timezone, composer version, pecl packages and etc.
3. I have hold some apt packages by using `apt-mark hold` command to prevent unwanted upgrades. eg: `apt-mark hold php8.1`.
4. Each PHP version has it's own **branch** for example for using PHP 8.2 use git branch `php8.2`
5. You can use these dockerfiles in three different environemtn `development`, `staging`, `production`.
6. The PHP `xdebug` feature is enabled in the development and staging environments.

# Container(s) Architecture:
:tophat: I assumed that you will have the following docker containers in your application. It is obvious that not all of these containers are necessary for all applications.
1. **laravel-for-web** container that included nginx + fpm to handle the web part of the project
2. **laravel-for-queue** container that handles Laravel's queue workers
3. **laravel-for-cron** container that handles Laravel's schedule tasks
4. **laravel-for-socket** container that handles Laravel's websocket

:cyclone: You can handle all these features in only one docker container but I have separated 
them to make them more maintainable for complicated applications.
